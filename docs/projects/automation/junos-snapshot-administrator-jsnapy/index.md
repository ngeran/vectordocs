Junos® Snapshot Administrator in Python (jsnapy) enables you to capture and audit runtime environment snapshots of your networked devices running the Junos OS. You can capture and validate the operational and configuration status of a device and review operational changes to a device. You create configuration files that define the scope of snapshots and customize the test criteria for the snapshot data.
