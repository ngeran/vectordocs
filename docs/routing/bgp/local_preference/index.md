summary: The Power of Local Preference. The first BGP attribute used to favor one route over another.
---

### Local Preference Power

Local preference is the highest tiebreaker in the BGP path selection process. If a BGP next hop is reachable and BGP knows multiple routes, BGP always chooses the route with the highest local preference to exit the AS.  
The local preference is a **well-known**, **discretionary** attribute, which means it must be supported by all BGP-speaking neighbors but does not have to be included in the BGP update message.  
Local preference is also **non-transitive**, meaning it stays within its own internal AS and cannot be advertised to an external BGP neighbor.

Let's now see how to configure and influance traffic with Local Preference. 

### Topology 

> Taken from Juniper vLabs

### Initial set up

vMX5 advertises the same route **192.168.235.0/24** to both vMX3 and vMX2. 

```
jcluser@vMX5# run show route advertising-protocol bgp 10.100.25.1 

inet.0: 16 destinations, 16 routes (16 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
  Prefix  Nexthop       MED     Lclpref    AS path
* 192.168.235.0/24        Self                                    I

[edit]
jcluser@vMX5# run show route advertising-protocol bgp 10.100.35.1    

inet.0: 16 destinations, 16 routes (16 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
  Prefix  Nexthop       MED     Lclpref    AS path
* 192.168.235.0/24        Self                                    I
```

vMX1 learns the same route from vMX2 and vMX3. Goes throught the Best Path Selection  
process and chooses the route from vMX2 because of the lower **Router ID**.  
In this case both neighbors advertise the route with the "Localpref" of **100** which is the **default**.

jcluser@vMX3# run show route protocol bgp

192.168.235.0/24   *[BGP/170] 00:20:44, localpref 100
                      AS path: 64544 I, validation-state: unverified
                    >  to 10.100.35.2 via ge-0/0/0.0
                    [BGP/170] 00:20:43, localpref 100, from 10.100.100.2

                    >  to 100.123.0.1 via fxp0.0
```

### Configuration 

Now lets create a policy to change the Local_Pref value to **200** and observe the impact.

> Change the the Local_Pref for all inbounds routes 
```
jcluser@vMX3# show policy-options 
policy-statement SET_LOCAL_PREF {
    term ROUTE {
        from next-hop 10.100.35.2;
        then {
            local-preference 200;
            accept;
        }
    }
}
```

> Change the the Local_Pref for a specific inbound route.
```
jcluser@vMX3# show policy-options 
policy-statement SET_LOCAL_PREF {
    term ROUTE {
        from {
            route-filter 192.168.235.0/24 exact;
        }
        then {
            local-preference 200;
            accept;
        }
    }
}
```

> Apply the policy inbound (**import**) to change the AS exit point.
```
jcluser@vMX3# show protocols bgp group to-AS64544 
type external;
import SET_LOCAL_PREF; <-- Inbound 
peer-as 64544;
neighbor 10.100.35.2;
```

### The Result 

After applying the policy vMX1 chooses the route learned from vMX3 because of the higher Local_Pref value.

```
jcluser@vMX1# run show route 192.168.235.0/24 exact detail

### Advertise to eBGP (non-transitive)

vMX3 has the route **192.168.123.0/24** with **localpref** of  **123**
```
jcluser@vMX3# run show route protocol bgp
