summary: How to influance the route selection with the approptiate attributes.
---

>Before the router even starts the route selection process it needs to make sure that the route is valid, checks the **Martian** routes, **AS loops** and **next-hop reachability**. 

## Best Path Selection

| Attribute                        | Preference   | Default Behavior                                    |
| :------------------------------- | :----------  | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Route Preference              | Lowest       | Default value is 170                                |
| 2. Local Preference              | Highest      | Default learned value is 100                        |
| 3. AS-Path                       | Shortest     | Usualy the first time route selection occurs        |
| 4. Origin                        | Lowest       | IGP (I) >  EGP (E), EGP > incomplete (?)            |
| 5. Multi Exit Discriminator (MED)| Lowest       | Compared when routes are learned from the same AS   |
| 6. Route Type                    | External     | Internal vs External, External prefered             |
| 7. IGP Cost                      | Lowest       | lowest cost towards the BGP next-hop                |
| 8. Internal vs External          | Lowest       | Lowest R-ID,  Oldest active route                   |
| 10. Cluster List                 | Shortest     | When route reflection is used                       |
| 11. Peer IP Address              | Lowest       | Multiple peerings between the same router           |

## Lowest Route Preference

The Juniper default BGP preference is 170 below you can see a route selection which is based on a non-default route preference of 160.
Junos OS is kind enough to tell us why the second route has lost in the route selection.  
> The Inactive Reason is **Route Preference**

## Route Type 

The directly adverised external route is preferred over the external route learned via an internal neighbor. 
This can be seen from the Local AS and Peer AS line.  
The **Local AS** and **Peer AS** line gives information on if the route is learned from an    
internal or external neighbor.  
The order of preference is:   
- Local redistributed routes into BGP **(Interior)**
- External route directly learned from External BGP peers **(Exterior)**
- External route learned through an Internal BGP peer **(Exterior via Interior)**

> Inactive reason **Interior > Exterior > Exterior via Interior**

## Lowest IGP cost

The active route is chosen based on the lowest IGP cost to the BGP next-hop, shown as protocol next-hop in the output.
The IGP cost is shown as metric2 in the output.  
The active route has a metric2 of 5 vs metric2 of 10 for the inactive.

> External sessions **Router-ID**

To use the Router-ID as a tie-breaker the command **path-selection external-router-id** needs to be coinfigured.
The inactive route behaves as the internal and has a router-id 10.100.100.2 which is higher than the 10.100.100.1.

## Cluster List

The shortest cluster list will be preferred when we have multiple route reflectors.

```
Output TBD

## Lowest Peer IP

This is the last tie-breaker we can come this when for load-balancing purposed two routers peer two or more time with eachother. 
The route has been selected based on the lowest peer ip address, shown as **Source** in the output.
